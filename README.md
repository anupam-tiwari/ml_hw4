# Lab 4 - Backoor attacks on Machine Learning

**Name:** Anupam Tiwari </br>
**NETID:** ast9885

## Overview

This repository contains the files associated with Lab 4 on Adversarial Machine Learning. The dataset and the badnet model can be downloaded from [CSAW-HackML-2020](https://github.com/csaw-hackml/CSAW-HackML-2020/tree/master/lab3). Due to resource constraints, the notebook is configured to run on NYU High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment with the following specifications:

- Number of cores: 2
- Memory: 32 GB
- GPU type: None
- CUDA Version: v11

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset and badnet model from [CSAW-HackML-2020](https://github.com/csaw-hackml/CSAW-HackML-2020/tree/master/lab3).

2. Upload the entire Lab 4 folder to the `scratch/netid` directory on NYU HPC.

3. Request a Jupyter Notebook session on NYU HPC.

4. Open the notebook in the Jupyter environment and navigate to the Lab 4 folder.

5. Adjust file locations in the notebook to link them to the dataset and badnet model.

6. Execute the notebook to run the code with the specified configurations.

Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to the NYU HPC environment to successfully run the notebook.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or have questions about the lab.
